# Bracket Pair Colorization Toggler

A simple extension that lets you easily toggle the global "[Bracket Pair Colorization](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_60#_high-performance-bracket-pair-colorization)" setting added in VS Code v1.60.

## How to run

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Win, Linux) / `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) and search for the `Toggle 'Bracket Pair Colorization'` command.

## Important

The extension only toggles the **global** "Bracket Pair Colorization" setting. If you have set the setting in your workspace, the extension will not work.
